Docker, Jlink & Spring Boot
===========================
A small example of how the complete build process could be put into docker,
not even requiring java or maven on the "building" host. 

How docker image-cache can be used to speed up the build. Well and slow it down
in some cases ;) 

And how a custom JRE can be created and added to the "finished" image.

Don't know if this is of actual value..
